## About

You're in Grave Danger is the ultimate death handling mod. With this mod you can configure almost every aspect of
when you die, from items you lose, to items you keep, to items you drop, to xp, to effects you get when respawning,
to health and hunger values being set when respawning, and much more.

A big part of this mod, although it is technically an optional feature, are the gravestones (feature enabled by default).
These gravestones generate when you die, and stores your loot, until you reclaim it.
The graves are also highly configurable, to where they can and can't generate, to what will end up in your grave,
how you retrieve your items, as well as many more configuration options.

Graves will also remember the layout of your items, and replace this layout when grave is claimed. This is however
configurable, and weather the grave layout or your current layout should be prioritized can be changed through the config.

The graves are also equipped with rendering features, like rendering a head of the deceased player, and their name, that
will help you keep track of whose grave is who's when playing with your friends.
All rendering can be configured.

## Features

The mod is available for NeoForge on 1.21!

You're in Grave Danger (YiGD for short) aims to be compatible with all inventory mods.
If you know of one that is not supported, let me (the developer of YiGD) know.

The mod is also compatible with all soulbound enchantments, as long as they're added to the soulbound enchantment tag.

Graves can be waterlogged, and renders can be adapted to the block the grave is standing on.

The mod also includes a large number of other features. If you're intrigued by what YiGD can do, check the configs.
The mod includes components that can control various aspects of the following, when a player die:
* Player Inventory
* Player experience points
* Player Respawn event
* Graves
* Additional registries such as a few items and enchantments

If you found ANYTHING there is not a config for, that you'd like to be configurable, let me know through discord, github,
or similar, and I'll see about making this configurable

The mod is under MIT license, so feel free to use this in your modpack!

This mod is required both on client and server, as it will add custom blocks and renderers.
It's intended for use in modpacks. If you're looking for a server side only grave mod, I'd recommend Universal Graves
