## About

You're in Grave Danger is highly customizable grave mod for the fabric mod loader.
This mod will add graves to your game, which will spawn at your death location with all your items. You can then go back and retrieve your lost items. The mod will remember your inventory layout and put everything back to where it was before you died. The mod is highly configurable. If you find ANYTHING that is not, that you would like to be configurable, please let me know so I can add a config for it.



If you play multiplayer you'll have no trouble finding which grave is yours, as both your face and player name will render on it (if you've enabled it in the config of course)



## Features

The mod is available for 1.16.5, 1.17, 1.18 and 1.19!

1.16.5, 1.17, and 1.18 versions are no longer actively maintained. I might go back on rare occations and packport the newer versions however, but this rarely happens. I can fix issues, but only if they are game-breaking. Do let me know of them however, and I will decide how serious they are.

The mod has compatibility for trinkets, inventorio, and a wide variety of other inventory mods. If there are any inventory mods that YiGD does not work with, let me know and I'll implement compat on my end.
The mod is technically compatible with every soulbound enchantment, since you can configure which enchantments should not be dropped on death in your grave, and which you should as well keep in your inventory when you respawn.

Graves can be waterlogged, and renders can be adapted to the block the grave is standing on


## Misc info

If you find any bug/missing config, or have a cool idea that would fit in the theme of the mod, please open an issue on the [github issue tracker](https://github.com/B1n-ry/Youre-in-grave-danger/issues)

The mod is under MIT license, so feel free to use this in your modpack!

This mod is required both on client and server, as it will add custom blocks and renderers.
