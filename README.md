## About

You're in Grave Danger is a mod centered around death.
So far this mod will only add graves to your game, which will spawn at your death location with all your items. You can then go back and retrieve your lost items. The mod will remember your inventory layout and put everything back to where it was before you died. The mod is highly configurable. In fact, if you think a config is missing that has anything to do with what happens when you die, it's not refered to as a missing feature, but a bug. (Not really but that's how serious I am about everything being configurable). 

 

If you play multiplayer you'll have no trouble finding which grave is yours, as both your face and player name will render on it (if you've enabled it in the config of course)

 

## Features

The mod is available for both 1.16.5, 1.17.1, and 1.18!
1.6.5 and 1.17.1 versions have compatibility for trinkets. All versions will work with every soulbound enchantment mod that exists (technically). You can add enchantment ids in the configs that should have the soulbound trait. You can even add the soulbound function to normal vanilla enchantments such as mending or efficiency.

The 1.16.5 version has compatibility with curios, which is missing from the 1.17.1 and 1.18 version as curios is only available up to 1.16. for fabric. The 1.16.5 version will not be actively updated, but if any bugs gets reported I'll try my best to fix them.


The 1.17.1 version have lots of features that the 1.16.5 version does not. These includes
 * Inventorio compat

 * Waterloggable graves
 * Adaptive renders for the ground layer of the grave model

 * And more!


The 1.18 version will include the same features as the 1.17.1 version, except some mod compatibilities since these mods does not currently have a 1.18 version
