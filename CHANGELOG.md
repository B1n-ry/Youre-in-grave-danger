# You're in Grave Danger 1.4.1

### Changes
- Slightly toned the player color down in the `/yigd moderate` command from vibrant green to darker green
- Added compatibility with fabric permissions api. I'm no longer "half stupid"! :)
- Added a very basic search function for the player select in the GUI you get when executing `/yigd moderate`

### Fixes
- Filters will no longer reset when changing pages in the GUIs
- Fixed graves that very rarely was placed in the wrong dimension
